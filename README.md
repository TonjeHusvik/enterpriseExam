When I first read the exam and saw the specifications, I got the idea that only a user with admin-authority should have the ability to post/delete and update an animal. In my mind a user with admin-authority could be an employee or owner of the shelter and they are using it do add, update or removing the animals at the shelter. A user is a possibly new animal-owner that is interested in getting an animal and therefore only have access to see information about them.

## My fuck-ups
Testers<br/>	When testing for the first time, all testers passes. The second time, the database is all wrecked up and half of the tests passes. Tried to fix it by putting @DirtiesContext at every function in both DatabaseIntegrationTest and FullSystemTest (because internet told me it would work) but it seems it is a bit randomly when it works or not. This is the same when running all test(all classes) as in FullSystemTest(main problem is in here)
Endpoints<br/>	Often getting error when going from endpoint to endpoint in postman, remember to reset the database often! When (for an example) deleting a user at id=1, that user doesnâ€™t exist when you afterwards are going to get animal from id=1! This is common sense, but it is easily to forget.

## Testers
I made a total of 38 passing tests. Argued a bit with IntelliJ but it seems that no coverage could be found when using mock in tests. But that is the reason to why I have so many tests, I wanted _everything_ to be tested and thought of.

## Overall
All requirements have been finished. I am satisfied with my solution.
